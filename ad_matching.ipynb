    "The objective of this lab is to implement the Adwords algorithm in the particular case when we have $N$ advertisers having budget $B$ and each bidding an amount of $1$. Moreover, queries arrive in batches of $B$ queries, $N$ times, and only advertises $A_i,\\dots,A_n$ bid on round $i$. The optimal algorithm would have revenue $NB$. Our aim is to see what the revenue of the BALANCE algorithm is."
